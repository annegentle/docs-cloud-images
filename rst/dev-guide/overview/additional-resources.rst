Intended Audience
-----------------

This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop applications by
using the Rackspace Cloud Images service REST application programming interface (API). 
It fully documents the Cloud Images API, which enables developers to interact with the 
storage components of the service.

The Cloud Images service is closely aligned with the Rackspace Cloud Servers service and 
Cloud Files service. Images are captured from, and applied to, cloud servers and are 
stored on, and retrieved from, Cloud Files storage.

To use the information provided here, you should have a general understanding of the 
Cloud Images service and have access to an installation of the Cloud Images service. You 
should also be familiar with the following technologies:

-  *RESTful* web services

-  *HTTP*/1.1

-  JSON data serialization format
