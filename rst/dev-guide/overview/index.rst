Overview

The Rackspace Cloud Images service enables developers to create and
manipulate images, image members, and associated metadata through a
simple Representational State Transfer (REST) web service interface.

Cloud Images has the following expected benefits:

- You can import and export images across multiple sources: public cloud, private cloud, 
  and sources external to Rackspace. 

     - Images are portable, taking full advantage of the open cloud.

     - Images are imported from a private cloud into the public cloud for cloud-bursting.

     - Images created in the public cloud can be imported to a private cloud, or to 
       another provider's cloud, for redundancy and high availability.

- Customers share images.

     - Users with multiple accounts share images among the accounts.

     - Images are shared as an informal "image marketplace".
