        <para>Server images are used to store a snapshot of a server's configuration. If you take an image of a server, you
            can create a new server from that image. The new server will have the same files and operating system that the
            original server had at the time the image was created.</para>
        <para>The &CImS; provides operations that enable you to manipulate images, to import and export images (by using
            tasks), and to share images with other people.</para>
        <para>To learn how to use an existing image, see <olink condition="dev" targetdoc="ci-devguide"

            <title>Image member statuses</title>
            <para>When an image producer wants to share an image with a potential image consumer, the producer creates an
                image member, linking the image and the consumer. Once an image is shared, the image is available for the
                consumer to use, regardless of image member status. Both producers and consumers can check the status of an
                image member.</para>
            <para>Image member status both controls whether the image appears in the consumer's image list and lets the
                producer know whether the consumer acknowledges the offer. If the consumer wants the image to appear in the
                image list, the consumer accepts the image. Otherwise, the consumer rejects the image.</para>
            <para/>
            <para>If the image producer no longer wants the share an image with a consumer, the producer deletes the image
                member. Once the image member is deleted, the consumer cannot use the image, and the image is removed from
                the consumer's image list.</para>

                            and may not have even noticed the offer. The producer might elect to send a reminder that the
                            image is available, but this is outside the scope of the &CImA;. <note>
                                <para>The consumer can still use the image, but must know the image ID, since the image is
                                    not in the image list.</para>
